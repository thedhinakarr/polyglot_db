# Database Selection Strategy

Our database selection follows a problem-first approach based on research by Dhinakar R in "Database Selection Framework: A Problem-First Approach" (2025).

## Four-Phase Selection Framework

### Phase 1: Identify Problem Domain
- Data structure analysis
- Relationship mapping
- Scale assessment
- Access pattern identification

### Phase 2: Evaluate Technical Requirements
- Consistency requirements
- Query complexity analysis
- Throughput specifications
- Latency constraints

### Phase 3: Consider Operational Factors
- Team capability assessment
- Integration requirements
- Total cost analysis
- Support evaluation

### Phase 4: Make Problem-Centric Decision
- Prioritization
- Trade-off analysis
- Multi-database consideration
- Implementation planning

## Database Selections

### Auth Service
- **PostgreSQL**: For user data
  - Strong consistency requirements (ACID)
  - Relational data model for user profiles
  - Complex queries for user management
- **Redis**: For sessions
  - Ultra-fast read/write operations
  - Built-in expiration features
  - Simple key-value data model

### Business Service
- **PostgreSQL**: For relational business data
  - ACID compliance for transactions
  - Complex relationships between business entities
- **MongoDB**: For flexible document data
  - Schema flexibility for varying product structures
  - Document-oriented data that doesn't require strict relationships

### Analytics Service
- **InfluxDB**: For time-series data
  - Optimized for time-based data
  - Efficient storage and querying of timestamped events
  - Built-in aggregation functions
