# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Polyglot Persistence System is designed as a microservices architecture with the following layers:

1. **Client Layer**: Web and mobile applications
2. **API Gateway Layer**: Single entry point for all client requests
3. **Service Layer**: Specialized microservices
4. **Message Bus Layer**: Asynchronous communication
5. **Database Layer**: Multiple specialized databases

## Services

### Auth Service (JavaScript/Node.js)
- User authentication and management
- Uses PostgreSQL for user data and Redis for sessions

### Business Service (Rust)
- Core business logic and transactions
- Uses PostgreSQL for relational data and MongoDB for document storage

### Analytics Service (Python)
- Data processing and analysis
- Uses InfluxDB for time-series data

## Communication Patterns

- **REST APIs**: For client-to-service communication
- **gRPC**: For high-performance service-to-service communication
- **Message Broker**: For asynchronous event-based communication

## Deployment

The system is containerized using Docker and can be deployed using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
